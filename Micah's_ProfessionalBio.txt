One quote I live by is, "Live life to the fullest." That's why I like exploring the world, making memories, spending time with friends. Its because doing all those things allow
me to just live life and enjoy what I like doing. This quote encourages me to make every moment count, to be highly driven, to step out of my comfort zone; It allows me to be me, to live without
mental restrictions.
